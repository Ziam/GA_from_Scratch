# GA_from_Scratch
 Genetric algorithm written from scratch to solve simple obj. function
 
 I wrote this code as a proof of concept after reading up on GAs and wanted to see if I could do it.
 
 The code is thoroughly commented to help you walk though my thought process
 
 Simply run the file 'simple_GA_from_scratch.m' in MATLAB, and at the end of execution, the optima 
 will be displayed in the command window and a plot showing the results of each generation will pop up.
 
 Let me know your thoughts.
